### 2016

- December 19. Our collaboration with Luis Herrera-Estrella´s lab on *Malate-dependent Fe accumulation is a critical checkpoint in the root developmental response to low phosphate* is now up on [biorxiv](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/12/19/095497).

- December 12. [Guillaume Lobet](http://plantmodelling.xyz/) visited us briefly before heading to the Phenomics conference at Cimmyt. He gave a talk on how his brand new lab is using plant modelling to understand how plants integrate signals from both soil and the atmosphere to grow.

- October 4. Our white paper on [Morphological plant modeling: Unleashing geometric and topologic potential within the plant sciences](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/10/04/078832) has been uploaded to biorxiv. Great collaborative effort as result of a NimBios workshop last year.

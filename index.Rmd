Rellán-Álvarez Lab
--------------------

**Our lab has moved to the North Carolina State University, Deparment of Structural and Molecular Biochemistry.** 

You can find us at Polk Hall, Room 145 (lab) and 148 office or shoot me an email at  rrellan[at]ncsu.edu.

If your are interested in joining our lab please take a look at our [current research areas](http://www.rrlab.org/research.html) for possible projects. Please read also our [lab philosophy](http://www.rrlab.org/expectations.html) about what to expect from me and what I would expect from you if we both decided to work together.

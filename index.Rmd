Welcome to the Rellán-Álvarez Lab  at [Langebio](http://www.langebio.cinvestav.mx). We work on plant adaptation to abiotic stress.

If your are interested in joining our lab please take a look at our [current research areas](http://www.rrlab.org/research.html) for possible projects. Please read also our [lab philosophy](http://www.rrlab.org/expectations.html) about what to expect from me and what I would expect from you if we both decided to work together.
